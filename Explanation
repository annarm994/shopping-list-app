I used the useImmer hook from the Immer library to manage state updates for a shopping list.

State Initialization:
I initialized the shoppingList state using useImmer, providing an initial array of item objects. Each item object contains nested properties.

State Updates:
useImmer allows us to directly modify nested state properties in an immutable way.
Functions like addItem, updateItem, and removeItem by useImmer to update the shoppingList state.
When adding a new item, we simply push the new item to the draft state array.
When updating an existing item, we locate the item by its id in the draft state and update its properties directly.
When removing an item, we find the index of the item by its id in the draft state array and splice it out.
